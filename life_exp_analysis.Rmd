# Abstract

Here, I re-examined the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Life Expectancy Analysis

```{r}

# Maximum Life Expectancy for each year and country which had the maximum life expectancy
# Save result to sumdat

gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  select(year, country, lifeExp) %>% 
  arrange(year) ->
  sumdat

```
